# Output Formats

Three formats. Pick the one that fits the question.

## 1. Evidence Wall

The workhorse. Most questions boil down to "what are people saying about X?" — this answers that directly. Forces you to go into transcripts, pull real quotes, and attribute them.

**Use for:** "What are customers saying about X?", "Show me feedback on Y", "What pain points came up?"

```
## Pricing Concerns (7 mentions across 5 people)

**"We can't justify the cost without seeing ROI in 90 days"**
— Sarah Chen (Acme Corp, Enterprise), Jan 15 2026

**"Competitors are offering bundled pricing that makes comparison impossible"**
— John Doe (Ford, Enterprise), Jan 5 2026

**"For our size, per-seat doesn't make sense"**
— Maria Lopez (TechStart, SMB), Dec 12 2025
```

## 2. Frequency Table

When you need to see patterns and prioritize — what's coming up most, what's loudest. The "People" column is critical because 14 mentions from 2 people is very different from 14 mentions across 8 people.

**Use for:** "What are the top pain points?", "Rank the most common themes", "How often did X come up?"

```
Theme                       | People | Mentions | Strength
----------------------------|--------|----------|----------
Slow onboarding             |  8/12  |    14    | ████████░░
Pricing confusion           |  5/12  |     9    | ██████░░░░
Missing integrations        |  4/12  |     7    | █████░░░░░
Poor mobile experience      |  2/12  |     4    | ███░░░░░░░
```

## 3. Segment Comparison

When comparing two groups — customer types, company sizes, industries, time periods. Forces a structured contrast with evidence from both sides.

**Use for:** "How do X vs Y think about Z?", "What's different between segments?", "Has sentiment changed over time?"

```
                    | Enterprise              | SMB
--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------
Absolute cost       | Secondary concern       | Primary blocker
Willingness to pay  | High if proven          | Low, price-sensitive
Comparison behavior | Formal RFP, 3-5 vendors | Quick Google search
Key quote           | "Show me the business   | "We just need it to
                    |  case" — Sarah Chen,    |  work" — Maria Lopez,
                    |  Acme                   |  TechStart
Data coverage       | 8 interactions          | 4 interactions
```
